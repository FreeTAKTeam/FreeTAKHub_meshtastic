# Meshtastic to FreeTAKServer Integration
## Introduction
This repository facilitates the integration of Meshtastic devices with FreeTAKServer (FTS) using Mosquitto MQTT broker and Node-RED. This setup enables the translation of Meshtastic messages into Cursor-on-Target (CoT) format, allowing seamless communication between Meshtastic LoRa mesh networks and Tactical Awareness Kit (TAK) clients.

## Architecture
This integration employs MQTT and Node-RED to bridge Meshtastic mesh networks with FreeTAKServer, an open-source TAK server implementation. This setup enables the transmission of position and chat messages from  Meshtastic devices to TAK clients like ATAK, iTAK, and WinTAK

## how is different from the Meshtastic Plugin for ATAK?
this integration is suoted  for scenarios necessitating centralized coordination, such as emergency response, search and rescue operations, and large-scale event management. The server-centric approach allows for comprehensive data aggregation and dissemination among multiple clients and systems.

## Installation
By following these steps, you can successfully activate and configure Node rd, MQTT and Meshtastic , enabling seamless communication between your mesh network and FreeTAKServer. 
### pre-requirements
we assume that you have already installed FTS using the ZeroTouch installer, so that you have FTS and Node Red already running. Also you have at least one meshtastic node that can connect to Wifi

### Install mosquitto
To install the Mosquitto MQTT broker on an Ubuntu server without using Docker, follow these steps:

1. **Update System Packages**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
   ```
   This ensures all existing packages are up-to-date.

2. **Add the Mosquitto PPA Repository**:
   ```bash
   sudo add-apt-repository ppa:mosquitto-dev/mosquitto-ppa
   sudo apt update
   ```
   Adding the Mosquitto PPA provides access to the latest versions of Mosquitto. 

3. **Install Mosquitto and Client Utilities**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install mosquitto mosquitto-clients -y
   ```
   This command installs both the Mosquitto broker and client utilities. 

4. **Enable and Start the Mosquitto Service**:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl enable mosquitto
   sudo systemctl start mosquitto
   ```
   Enabling the service ensures Mosquitto starts on boot. 

5. **Verify the Installation**:
   ```bash
   mosquitto -v
   ```
   This command displays the installed Mosquitto version, confirming a successful installation. 

## Configuration
you will need to:
* Configure mosquitto
* configure a Meshtastic Node to pass messages to Moquitto
### Configure mosquitto
On Ubuntu , the primary configuration file for the Mosquitto MQTT broker is located at:

```
/etc/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf
```

This file contains the main settings for the Mosquitto service. Additionally, configuration snippets can be placed in the `/etc/mosquitto/conf.d/` directory. Files in this directory are included in the main configuration and can be used to modularize settings.


**Edit the Configuration File**: Use a text editor with elevated privileges to edit the file. For example:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/mosquitto/conf.d/meshtasticIntegration.conf
   ```
   
   add the following
   ``` conf
allow_zero_length_clientid true
listener 1883 0.0.0.0
allow_anonymous true
protocol mqtt

log_type error
log_type warning
log_type notice
log_type information
log_type subscribe
```
> **Warning**  
> this is the minimum configuration, for production you need to secure your server.

**Apply Changes**: After saving your changes, restart the Mosquitto service to apply them:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart mosquitto
   ```
## configure a Meshtastic Node to pass messages to Moquitto
To enable MQTT functionality in the Meshtastic Android application, follow these steps:

**Access Radio Configuration:**
   - Open the Meshtastic app on your Android device.
   - Tap the three-dot menu (â‹®) in the top-right corner.
   - Select "Radio Configuration."

**Enable the MQTT Module:**
   - Scroll to the "MQTT" section.
   - Toggle the "MQTT Enabled" switch to the "On" position.
   - Tap "Send" to apply the changes.
   - Configure MQTT Settings:
   - **Server Address:** Enter your MQTT broker's address. If left blank, the default public server is used.
 
   - **JSON Enabled:** Toggle based on your integration needs.

   - **Root Topic:** Define ````msh/US```a root topic to organize MQTT messages
   - **Client Proxy Enabled:** If your LORA radio  lacks WIFI  access, enabling this allows it to use your phone's connection.

**Enable Channel Uplink and Downlink:**
   - In "Radio Configuration," navigate to "LoRa Config."
   - activate "OK to MQTT"
**Enable Channel Uplink and Downlink:**
   - In "Radio Configuration," navigate to "Channels."
   - Select the 'Longfast'.
   - Enable "Uplink" to allow the device to publish mesh packets to MQTT and to FTSS.
     **Note:** Future feature
   - Enable "Downlink" to permit the device to subscribe to MQTT and forward packets to the mesh.
   - Tap "Save" to confirm settings.

**Configure Network Settings:**
   - If your device connects via Wi-Fi:
     - Ensure "Wi-Fi Enabled" is active.
     - Enter the SSID and password of your Wi-Fi network.
     - Tap "Save" to apply.
   - If using your phone's internet connection:
     - Enable "Client Proxy to client enabled" to allow the device to utilize the phone's network for MQTT communication.

**Note:** Proper configuration of network settings and channel permissions is crucial for effective MQTT integration. For detailed information, refer to the [Meshtastic MQTT Module Configuration](https://meshtastic.org/docs/configuration/module/mqtt/).
